# Group-Project
Python 2023-24

#One student will design the function main, which will call all other functions in the program.  The remainder of the functions will be divided amongst all members of the team.
The requirements of the program should be analyzed as a team and split up so each student is given about the same workload.
It is important the parameters of each function and its return values be decided ahead of time.
The program should be implemented and shared using github. (The person writing main should create a public repository and share it with all other members of the team).

Here is the assignment: Create a Python program for a number guessing game that uses a menu-driven approach. The game should allow two players to take turns guessing a random number within a specified range (chosen via the menu). The program should incorporate inputs, loops, if-then statements, and functions.

When the "Start New Game" option is selected, the program should:
Prompt the players to enter their names.
Allow users to choose the range of values to guess
Generate a random number within the chosen range.
Allow the players to take turns guessing the number.
Provide feedback after each guess.
Keep track of the number of turns.
Display the winner and the number of turns it took to win

Here is a breakdown of the required functions:

-A main function to drive the program
-A function to display the menu and return the choice
-A function to prompt for and return each player's name
-A function to generate and return a random integer within the specified min/max
-A function that takes turns guessing a number, providing feedback after each guess and keep track of the number of turns.

The menu options for the program should be:
Start New Game
Choose Range
 Exit

Validate all inputs for non-integers and out-of-range guesses.

For me, the most challenging part of doing the group project was figuring out how to use the branches on Github; if I was accidentally still in a branch when I was working on main, Github wouldn't allow it to merge and I had to undo the changes. However, I feel like now that I have more experience working in a shared repository, I understand how it works much better and it would be easier to use in the future.
